# IMDB-Reviews--Data-Analysis

# Project Overview
This project aims to identify the most profitable genre for an upcoming movie, assisting stakeholders in making data-driven decisions. The analysis uses IMDb movie review data to explore trends, audience preferences, and financial performance across genres.

# Business Question
Which genre should the upcoming movie focus on to maximize audience engagement and profitability?

# Data Collection and Preparation
	•	Data Source: IMDb dataset from Kaggle.
	•	Data Cleaning:
	•	Handled missing values and removed irrelevant columns.
	•	Split ‘Genre’ column into multiple entries for movies with more than one genre.
	•	Adjusted outliers in financial metrics to prevent skewed analysis.

# Analysis and Visualizations
Using Power BI, the following analyses were conducted:
	1.	Trend Analysis: Visualized genre popularity and revenue trends over time, highlighting consistent high-performing genres.
	2.	Genre Performance: A bar chart shows views and ratings per genre, where Action and Comedy genres attract the most audience views, indicating high engagement.
	3.	Revenue vs. Ratings: Analyzed the correlation between gross revenue and IMDb ratings. Genres like Drama score high on IMDb but have variable financial outcomes, while Action and Comedy balance both.

# Key Findings
	•	Top Genres: Action and Comedy genres not only attract the highest views but also consistently bring in higher revenue, making them suitable choices for profitability.
	•	Audience Ratings: Drama and Thriller genres receive strong IMDb ratings, reflecting a dedicated viewer base, though they may not yield the highest revenue.

# Conclusion
For maximum profitability and audience engagement, Action and Comedy genres are recommended for the upcoming movie. This project’s insights are visualized through interactive Power BI charts that illustrate genre performance trends, audience engagement, and financial outcomes, enabling stakeholders to make strategic decisions.
